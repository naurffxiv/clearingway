The App package holds the three files that actually run and wire the whole bot together. First, main.go should be solely used for the initialization of the bot and injecting dependencies throughout the bot. Second, config.go handles the ENV, the config files, and validates and defines the shape of the config data. Finally routes.go will handle the wiring of the commands and events, the registry so we can register the bot flow throughout the codebase.
